# CoGood: Concept-based Out-of-Distribution Detection for Texts using Graph-Nueral-Networks
CoGood is a novel approach for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in text data that leverages extracted concepts and bipartite graph structure for enhanced explainability and scalability.
The model uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to train on data, improving its capability to classify whether a text is in-distribution (IN) or out-of-distribution (OOD).
